        This page serves as a practice project to learn the fundamentals of HTML. It includes different types of content to demonstrate a basic understanding of web page structure. From simple paragraphs to different heading levels and even an image, each element is a building block for more complex web designs.

    <!-- Sub-heading for a section of the page -->
    <h2>About This Page</h2>

    <!-- Second paragraph providing more details -->
    <p>
        The purpose of this project is to apply the concepts learned about HTML elements and metadata. We will be using this file to practice adding and manipulating different tags, ensuring the code is valid and well-structured.

    <!-- Another paragraph with a different focus -->
    <p>
        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

    <!-- A more specific sub-heading -->
    <h3>Why is HTML Important?</h3>

    <!-- Fourth paragraph explaining the importance of HTML -->
    <p>
        HTML provides the fundamental structure for every website. Without it, a web page would have no defined sections, headings, or content to display. It is the core foundation upon which all web content is built, ensuring a consistent experience for users across different browsers and devices.
